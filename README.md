This is a project based on Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System (Item-based) using Streamlit. It simplifies movie selection by recommending similar movies when a specific film is searched, providing a more personalized and enjoyable movie-watching experience. It recommends a list of the top 5 movies that are similar to the one being searched for. Hope you enjoy it:)

3. **Open Anaconda Prompt, enter the current directory of the folder using 'cd' command :** ```cd folder_path```.
   <br>**For Example:** ```cd C:\Users\Desktop\Github\Item-based-Collaborative-Filtering-Movie-RS```<br><br> 
4. **Run this command after step3 , to launch your streamlit app :** ```streamlit run app.py``` (make sure you have entered the current directory where app.py is present using 'cd' command)
